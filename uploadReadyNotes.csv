"Why does Aristotle believe that human beings have a natural function?","He believes that all things have a function and that goodness comes when that function is fulfilled (you have done it well)." 
"Why does Aristotle believe that the natural function of human beings is to live rationally?","He believes that function is based on what is distinctive and he believes that rationality is what is distinctive about human beings." 
"What does relative to us mean?","Relative to us: the mean depends on everyone (you take everyone’s extremes and find the average). BUT different people can vary slightly and still be close enough to the mean to be considered virtuous. That is what “relative to us” means." 
"Using the example of a courageous action, explain what Aristotle mean when he says the mean that characterizes a virtuous action is “relative to us?”","-Situation: For fear/overconfidence mean = courage, deficiency = cowardice & excess = rashness. There is a fire & someone is trapped. -Cowardly:  You’re too scared to help. -Rash: You’re going to run in & not have a plan, and not be effective in helping the person.-Courageous: You’re going to have just the right amount of fear so that you will think through a plan and enough confidence that you will be willing to do something to help. Therefore, you will be able to effectively help the person. You can vary in how courageous you are; as long as you are in the “courageous range” you are still close enough to the mean to be virtuous." 
"Explain the different ways Aristotle and Mill believe virtuous character traits are valuable.","Mill believes that virtuous traits are good as a means to happiness. They are good because they bring about more happiness. Aristotle believes that virtuous traits (=excellent traits) are good because they enable us to act in accord with reason, are the average, contribute to social harmony, and enable us to correctly feel and have intentions. " 
"According to Aristotle, what is the difference between acting virtuously and just acting the way a virtuous person does?","Acting virtuously requires that one 1.) Intends it 2.) Has knowledge of it 3.) Chooses it for its own sake A virtuous person cannot do a virtuous act by chance. Acting the way a virtuous person does not require that those 3 things be fulfilled." 
"What is the initial anti-abortion argument that Thomson discusses in her essay?","1. All persons have a right to life. 2. A fetus is a person. 3. The right to life is stronger than the right of a woman to decide what happens in her own body. 4. Therefore, abortion is immoral." 
"How does Thomson try to use the violinist thought experiment to show that the argument is not sound.","You wake up one morning and find that you have been attached to a famous violinist who needs to use your body in order to survive (specifically, to filter a toxin from your blood). The Society of Music Lovers did this to you and tells you that you have to stay attached to the violinist for nine months otherwise he will die. Are you obliged to remain attached to the violinist? No, the right to life does not give one the right to another person’s body." 
"What is the people seed thought experiment that Thomson gives? What is the point of it?","People seeds float around and if they enter your house and take root a person will grow. You buy the best screen for your window you can but it still gets in. You can kill it because you tried to prevent it. The point is about contraception and abortions." 
"What is the personhood theory of what makes it the case that something has a right to life? How do proponents of this view argue for the moral acceptability of abortion?","1.  Consciousness and in particular the capacity to feel pain; 2.  Reasoning 3.  Self-motivated activity (outside of genetics) 4.  The capacity to communicate a variety of messages 5.  The presence of self-concepts and self-awareness. Must possess most of these in order to be a human being in a moral sense (not genetic sense); the more you possess, the closer you are to a person and the closer you are the more right to life you have (that’s why dolphins, elephants, etc need a good reason to be killed). They argue that a fetus is not a person and therefore doesn’t have the right to life. Since it doesn’t have the right to life, killing it/abortion is okay with reason." 
"What is the sanctity of human life view and how is this view used to argue against the morality of abortion?","Every human life, from conception through death, is to be valued, respected, nurtured, and protected. (Very typical religious argument). Therefore abortion (killing a human life in the form of a fetus) is wrong." 
"What are the reasons Marquis gives for thinking his theory of what makes killing wrong is superior to the sanctity of human life view and the personhood view?","FT = Marquis’s Future Thesis (his main argument) 1. FT explains why death is avoided and considered a great evil. 2. FT allows that it may be wrong to kill beings other than humans. 3. FT allows for Active Euthanasia in cases where no future worth living can be reasonably expected. 4. Unlike personhood theories of the wrongness of killing, FT implies that killing babies and children is, in most cases, morally wrong." 
"What is the psychological continuity view of personal identity that we discussed in class?","-Psychological Continuity Theory: A person at one time is the very same person as a person at a later time if and only if only if the person at the later time is the person at the later time is psychologically continuous with the person at the earlier time. - There is a chain of person-stages connected by episodic memory" 
"How can psychological continuity be used to argue against Marquis's theory?","To have a future like ours assumes that one is identical to some person who will experience that future. But a fetus is not a person, and so it cannot be identical to any future person. Indeed, none of the relations deemed relevant to the identity of persons are present between a fetus because a fetus lacks a psychology with memories, beliefs, desires, and a general character capable of establishing any sort of plausible connection to a future experiencer, so that any experiences that experiencer undergoes cannot be the fetus's future experiences. Since they don’t have a future like ours, it rejects Marquis’s theory." 
"How might one argue for animal rights based on the hedonistic utilitarian moral theory?","Suffering and pain are bad things that should be minimized. Animal suffering is not an exception and therefore should be avoided as well." 
"Explain how Regan uses the “Aunt Bea” example to try to argue against utilitarianism? How is this example similar to the organ harvesting surgeon example?","He shows that it deemphasizes the individual. The best balance of consequences (what a utilitarian would choose) is not always the best for everyone involved (Aunt Bea suffers a great deal for the good of everyone else). It also allows any evil/violation of rights to be committed if it makes a number of people significantly happy." 
"According to Regan, what is it that is fundamentally wrong about the way human beings use animals?","He believes that animals (as experiencing subjects of a life) have inherit value and therefore rights. Human beings do not treat animals like they have rights." 
"How does Regan argue that philosophers like Kant are wrong to think that only rational beings have inherent value?","-All individual experiencing subjects of a life have inherent value (have moral standing or intrinsic value, a type of value not reducible to use/instrumental value for others). - Inherent value doesn't come in degrees, so rationality isn’t important.. Inherit value does not have to be earned. -Having inherent value = possessing rights = it is wrong to treat an individual with inherent value as a mere resource or thing or instrument that exists for the sake of others' benefits." 
"In what way is Regan’s view of moral obligation similar to the Kantian theory?","Regan believes that it is wrong to use animals merely as a means and not as an end in themselves, just as Kant believes it is wrong to use human beings merely as a means and not as an end."
